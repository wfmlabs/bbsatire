            <div class="prose max-w-none">
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">In a move that left political analysts reeling and late-night comedians scrambling to keep up, former President Donald Trump announced today that he would not only dismantle the Department of Education but appoint Beavis and Butthead as joint Secretaries of Education to oversee its final days.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">"They're the best—two for the price of one! Tremendous efficiency, okay? The Department of Education has been a disaster, a total disaster, and Beavis and Butthead are going to clean it up," Trump declared at a press conference in his signature style, pointing to the duo, who stood behind him wearing mismatched suits and grinning vacantly. "Beavis is all about energy, and Butthead? He's got… ideas. Great ideas. You'll love it."</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">"Dumbing Down to Smart Up"</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Trump's rationale for appointing the animated slackers? "The system is too complicated! Too many big words and books nobody reads," he explained. "We need relatable people. Beavis and Butthead are relatable! They're icons. The kids love them."</p>

                <img 
                    src="public/beavis-butthead.jpg"
                    alt="Beavis and Butthead in Washington"
                    class="w-full h-[400px] object-cover rounded-lg my-6"
                />

                <p class="mb-4">The duo wasted no time unveiling their revolutionary educational vision. In a joint statement delivered between bouts of giggling, they proposed several key reforms:</p>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>"Fire Drill Fridays": Replace standardized tests with weekly fire drills to keep things "fun and safe."</li>
                    <li>School Lunch Reform: "Cornholio-themed" taco Tuesdays nationwide.</li>
                    <li>Simplified Curriculums: Replace algebra with "how to laugh at stupid stuff."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">State-Controlled Chaos</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Trump's announcement dovetails with his promise to return educational power to the states. "Let the states figure it out," he said. "If they want to teach math, fine. If they want to teach TikTok dancing, also fine. We're cutting out the middleman. So much waste—gone."</p>

                <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">"This is not just satire—it's insanity," said one education policy expert. "Beavis and Butthead have no experience, no qualifications, and are, frankly, fictional."</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">The End of Federal Oversight</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Trump assured reporters that Beavis and Butthead's roles would be short-lived. "They're here to dismantle, okay? No more Department of Education, no more federal meddling. We'll save millions, maybe billions! And these two? They'll do it twice as fast."</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Whether Trump's latest gambit will succeed remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: education in America has never been this entertaining—or terrifying.</p>
